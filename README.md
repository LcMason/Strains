# Medicinal Wellness Center

## 📖 OVERVIEW 
Creating my own REST API with JSON Server that includes an array of objects, I was able to create the **Medicinal Wellness Center**, a single page application that allows users to search different diagnoses which will return specific strains of cannabis that will help manage the diagnosis.**This app allows you to search a diagnosis that will return different strains of cannabis that will manage the searched diagnosis. The populated strains will also have information pertaining to the name, strain, species, an image, top effect, flavor and aroma, THC percentage, and rating.** If you would like to clear your searched diagnosis, you can either clear the search box or simply refresh the page!

## 🌟 FEATURES
*Utilize UseEffect and a GET request to Display All Strains upon the load of the DOM
*3 client-side routes using React Router
*Form route to create a new strain (Submit)
*About route wtih information specific to the benefits of cannabis
*Search Diagnoses that will populate all strains that can manage searched diagnosis.
*Hover over Routes (mouse over)
